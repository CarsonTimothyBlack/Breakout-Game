This is a Breakout Game building tutorial, using JavaScript that can be found on MDN.

I am going through this not only to get more comfortable with JavaScript but to begin an understanding of game development.

This is also acting as a practice for using Github Desktop as my local git software. My Blackjack Javascript project is a practice in using mac terminal with git commands as the git software.
